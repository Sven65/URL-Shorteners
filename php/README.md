# URLS

**URL S**hortener

URLS requires PHP and MySQL.

## Getting started

To start using URLS, simply download it [here](), unzip the archive into a folder of your choice and rename `URLS-Master` to something of your choice.
After this, navigate to &lt;where/you/installed/URLS&gt;/install `(Eg: localhost/URLS/install)`.
This will be a setup page.

After this, you're done!
